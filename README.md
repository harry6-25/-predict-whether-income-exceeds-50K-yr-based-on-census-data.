## Objective: Build machine learning models to predict 
### whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.   
### Requirements:
### • Please use python jupyter notebook to finish this exercise
### • Perform feature exploration, feature engineering and modelling steps and explain each step using basic comments
### • For feature exploration performing data visualization would be a bonus. 
### • Strongly recommend trying out various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, xgboost etc.
### • You can use python libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly etc.
